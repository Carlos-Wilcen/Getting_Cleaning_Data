The tidy_data.txt file consists in a data set with 1029 rows and 68 columns from experiments with a group of 30 subjects. The data presents each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. \
\
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope it was captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The features selected from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. \
The prefix 't' to denote time captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) and the data set present the mean an standard deviation for each measure.\
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). The data set present the mean an standard deviation for each measure.\

The prefix 'f' indicate frequency domain signals. The data shows a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. The data set present the mean an standard deviation for each measure.\

\
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  \
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.\
